Scoop Bucket containing apps I use which aren't included in the official ones.

## How do I install these manifests?

After manifests have been committed and pushed, run the following:

```pwsh
scoop bucket add KowoBucket https://github.com/MrKowo/KowoBucket
scoop install KowoBucket/<manifestname>
```
