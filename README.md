# Kowo Scoop Bucket

Scoop Bucket containing apps I use which aren't included in the official ones.

## How do I install these manifests?

To start using the bucket, assuming you have Scoop installed, run the following:

```pwsh
scoop bucket add KowoBucket https://github.com/MrKowo/KowoBucket
scoop install KowoBucket/<manifestname>
```

A list of the apps included can be found [here](bucket).
