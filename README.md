# KowoBucket

Scoop Bucket containing apps I use which aren't included in the official ones.

## How do I use this?

Assuming you have [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) installed, run the following in a powershell window to add the bucket:

```pwsh
scoop bucket add KowoBucket https://github.com/MrKowo/KowoBucket
```
To install an app run:

```pwsh
scoop install KowoBucket/<manifestname>
```

A full list of the apps included can be found [here](bucket).
